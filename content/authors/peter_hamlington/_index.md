Dr. Peter Hamlington is an Associate Professor, Associate Chair, and Vogel Faculty Fellow in the Paul M. Rady Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU). Dr. Hamlington also has a courtesy appointment in the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at CU and a joint appointment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO. Research in his group, the Turbulence and Energy System Laboratory, is focused on understanding and modeling turbulent flows in both engineering and geophysical problems using large eddy and direct numerical simulations. Dr. Hamlington and his group have used numerical simulations for the study of a broad range of applications, including unsteady, boundary layer, chemically reacting, and oceanic flows, as well as boundary layer flows relevant to renewable energy systems. The primary emphasis in many of these studies has been to understand fundamental flow physics and to use the resulting insights for the development of physically accurate, computationally efficient models for large-scale simulations of real-world problems, as well as for optimization, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification. Dr. Hamlington has a BA in Physics from the University of Chicago and MS and PhD degrees in Aerospace Science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
