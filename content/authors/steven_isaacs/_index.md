Steven joined TESLa as a PhD student in 2015. Steven’s research interests included computational modeling and 
optimization of two-phase thermal management devices. Steven’s focus involved experimentation and numerical 
modeling of thin vapor chambers. Steven is a Sr. Thermal Engineer at Roccor where his responsibilities include 
design and modeling of both passive and active cooling technologies for aerospace and military applications.
