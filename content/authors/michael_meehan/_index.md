Mike graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in May 2022 with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. As a member of TESLa, Mike focused on two main area: highly buoyancy driven flows with applications to industrial burners and large scale fires, and turbulent flame configurations with applications to Air Force relevant problems.
