In TESla lab I was working on a data-driven turbulence modeling using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach. 
I'm interested in Data Analysis, Bayesian statistics, Machine Learning and how they can be used to 
improve turbulence simulations.   

Before joining TESLa I worked on dynamical mesh adaptation algorithms for unstructured meshes 
(moving meshes) in the Computational Aeroacoustic Laboratory (CAA lab) at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (RAS).

I received my B.S. and M.S in Applied Mathematics and Physics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology 
(MIPT, Phystech). During my thesis research practice in the CAA lab I studied the problem of acoustic scattering 
by an isolated vortex and sound radiation by a perturbed Rankine vortex.
