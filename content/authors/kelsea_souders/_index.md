# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
# bio: Tyler is a first-year graduate student currently working with simulations of premixed combustion with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). He is interested both in the flow physics governing the behavior of internal combustion processes and simulations thereof.
# bio: Tyler is a second-year PhD student currently working on simulations of bluff body stabilized premixed combustion. His work involes the use of highly-scalable adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) codes with HPC systems. The use of AMR allows us to spatially resolve the flow without the use of turbulence models or Large-Eddy simulations (LES), but also keeps the simulations tractable by greatly reducing the total number of grid cells compared to traditional direct numerical simulations (DNS).
bio: Kelsea joined the TESLa group in 2021 after completing her M.S. in mechanical engineering from Arizona State University. She uses modern CFD techniques on HPC systems to gain insight into the physics governing realistic reacting flows. Through the use of adpative mesh refinement (AMR), she is able to resolve flame simulations at the same resolution as direct numerical simulations (DNS) at a fraction of the computational cost relative to a uniform-grid DNS simulation. Kelsea also contributes significant effort into the development and maintenance of post-processing tools useful for parsing large amounts of AMR simulation data in a computationally-efficient manner.
