# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Kelsea joined the TESLa group in 2021 after completing her M.S. in mechanical engineering from Arizona State University. She uses modern CFD techniques on HPC systems to gain insight into the physics governing realistic reacting flows. Through the use of adpative mesh refinement (AMR), she is able to resolve flame simulations at the same resolution as direct numerical simulations (DNS) at a fraction of the computational cost relative to a uniform-grid DNS simulation. Kelsea also contributes significant effort into the development and maintenance of post-processing tools useful for parsing large amounts of AMR simulation data in a computationally-efficient manner.
