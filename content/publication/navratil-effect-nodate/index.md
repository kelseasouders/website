abstract: "This paper presents results of the second Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop which uses the Benchmark Super-Critical Wing, BSCW at ﬂutter conditions as a common test case. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of angle of attack. To do so, we analyzed BSCW wing at three angles of attack - α = 0deg, α = 1deg and α = 5deg. The second task is to evaluate the effect of gas composition on ﬂutter boundary. The two gases are R-12 heavy gas which was used as a test medium for the wind tunnel test and air."
