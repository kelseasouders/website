abstract: "Turbulent combustion is a multi-scale and multi-physics problem depending upon both chemical and ﬂuid dynamic processes. These processes are often examined using an Eulerian framework, but recently the Lagrangian framework, a long-time tool in non-reacting ﬂow research, has become increasingly common for the study of turbulent combustion. The two analysis frameworks are in fact equivalent, with the only difference being a change in reference frame. In this study, a Lagrangian ﬂuid parcel tracking algorithm is used to analyze the enstrophy (i.e., vorticity magnitude) dynamics in turbulent premixed reacting ﬂows. The analysis of vorticity dynamics in the premixed ﬂame case is based on data from a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of a premixed stoichiometric hydrogen-air ﬂame in an unconﬁned domain. Vorticity budget terms are tracked along Lagrangian trajectories as ﬂuid parcels travel through the ﬂame, with particular focus on understanding the dynamical causes of turbulence variations through the ﬂame preheat and reaction zones."
