 abstract = {Intermittency is an important metric for determining the likelihood of extreme ﬂuctuating quantities in turbulent premixed ﬂames. Such extreme quantities may lead to ﬂow-altering events including extinction, auto- and re-ignition, and deﬂagration to detonation transitions. Here we analyze intermittency of enstrophy (i.e., vorticity magnitude) and temperature gradient magnitude ﬁelds based on data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of stoichiometric premixed ﬂames in unconﬁned domains. The DNS are performed for different turbulence intensities and fuels, for single- and multi-step chemistry models, for varying spatial resolution, and for temperature-dependent and constant viscosities. These simulations thus enable the study of physical effects on intermittency, as well as the study of effects based on simulation ﬁdelity. We show that intermittency in the temperature gradient magnitude varies with the chemistry model but has little dependence on viscosity, while enstrophy intermittency varies with the viscosity model, but has little dependence on the ﬁdelity of the chemistry.},
