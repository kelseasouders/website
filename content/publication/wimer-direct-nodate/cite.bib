 abstract = {Preliminary results are presented from a new research effort focused on understanding and characterizing wildland ﬁre spread at small scales (roughly 1 m – 1 mm) using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The simulations are intended to directly resolve, with high physical accuracy, all small-scale ﬂuid dynamic and chemical processes relevant to wildland ﬁre spread. Simulation of wildland ﬁres is an incredibly complex and challenging problem due to the vast difference in scales associated with the problem. An understanding is needed not just of the burning of fuel, but also of the atmospheric conditions, weather patterns, topography, and turbulence-ﬂame dynamics. This work is focused on the sub-meter scales associated with wildland ﬁre; in particular, the dynamics of small-scale diffusion ﬂames. Here, preliminary results are presented for DNS of gaseous pool ﬁres coupled with an inﬁnitely-fast chemical reaction mechanism. The results are connected to the fundamental structure and spread of wildland ﬁres, and an outlook is provided for the future expansion of these DNS studies.},
