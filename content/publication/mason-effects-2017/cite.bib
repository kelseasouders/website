 abstract = {The effects of climate oscillations on spatial and temporal variations in wildland ﬁre potential in the continental U.S. are examined from 1979 to 2015 using cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions (CSEOFs). The CSEOF analysis isolates effects associated with the modulated annual cycle and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results show that, in early summer, wildland ﬁre potential is reduced in the southwest during El Niño but is increased in the northwest, with opposite trends for La Niña. In late summer, El Niño is associated with increased wildland ﬁre potential in the southwest. Relative to the mean, the largest impacts of ENSO are observed in the northwest and southeast. Climate impacts on ﬁre potential due to ENSO are found to be most closely associated with variations in relative humidity. The connections established here between ﬁre potential and climate oscillations could result in improved wildland ﬁre risk assessment and resource allocation.},
